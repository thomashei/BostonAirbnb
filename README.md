## Installation

The code does not require any additional libraries beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. It is compatible with Python versions 3.* and should run without any problems.

## Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to gain insights into the Boston real estate market and the preferences of travelers to the area using the Boston Airbnb dataset. We will investigate the impact of seasonality, neighborhoods, and accommodation features on the listing price of short-term rental properties in Boston. By analyzing this data, we hope to provide valuable information for both property owners and travelers looking to rent in the city.

## File Descriptions
Ther is only one notebook included in this repository. Please note that only calendar and listings dataset are used in this analysis. The review dataset was loaded in but not used due unrealted business question.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@thomashei0828/how-much-can-you-earn-from-the-boston-airbnb-market-e0146c7db108).
